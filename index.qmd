# Motivation {.unnumbered}

Colette and I both utilize Letterboxd and enjoy films; we both are aware that the typical Letterboxd user tends to be a "cinephile", trending towards a movie snob rather than a casual enjoyer.
People may be surprised by a low Letterboxd average score for a film, but we both take it with a grain of salt because Letterboxd users often do not rate movies very high despite enjoying it.
However, is the idea of Letterboxd actually rating films lower than other rating websites true, or is this a bias we have that is only founded on the perceived culture of the app?
It is with this in mind we hope to explore top films' ratings on Letterboxd and IMDb to compare if Letterboxd actually rates them lower than the more popular site.
This information would help to better understand the culture of both rating sites, and help those looking at movie ratings better understand the rating of a film in context.

# Research Question {.unnumbered}

How do average Letterboxd scores compare to average IMDb scores for top films?
Does Letterboxd rate films lower than IMDb?

Our goal is to determine if the perceived culture of Letterboxd actually translates to how people rate films.
We hope to communicate information about typical ratings patterns on each website to help users make more informed movie selections.

# Data Insights {.unnumbered}

It’s your job to explicitly identify and discuss key insights.

Specifically address the following questions:

```         
What are the important takeaways from the data? What was interesting?
Why do these takeaways matter?
Was there anything surprising?
Overall, what do you want the audience to walk away with? What do you want them to understand about your data and research questions?
```
