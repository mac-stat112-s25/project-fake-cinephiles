Observation of Crossword Scandal Article:

Visualizations are used both in graphs and pictures (pictures of similar crossword clues and words are highlighted to show similarities, and graphs show the exact number of crosswords with similarities).
Sideways bar graphs are used for comparison, which work well with the data being shown.
Relevant information to the story is highlighted in different colors on graphs.
There are also stacked bar graphs in the article, highlighting percentages instead of specific numbers of copied crosswords.
Each visual is labelled, captioned, and colored in an easy-to-see way.
There's proper context for each of the graphs.
The graphs support the story being told very well about plagiarism in the crossword community.
